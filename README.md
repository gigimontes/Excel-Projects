 #### Results
The results found in the data are:

  - The age bracket with the highest bike purchases is middle aged people who are in the age range between 31-54. People in the middle aged bracket were also the highest in not purchasing a bike.
  - The average income for female bike purchasers is 53,440 a year while for males it's 60,124 a year. Overall the higher the salary, the higher the chance of a purchase.
  - Consumers were more likely to purchase a bike if the commute travel was between 0-2 miles. On the contrary, consumers were more likely to not go through with the purchase if the commute was between 5 miles or more. 

#### Recommendations
  - I would focus on marketing towards the age range for people in their Adolescence to middle ages. 
  - I would recommend having a Uni-sex bike section that suits both men and women, men section, and women section that has 3 
    pricing brackets each. The pricer the bike the more features it has. This way we expand our affordability to more 
    consumers. 
  - I would market towards people who live in cities or suburbs due to the space dedicated for bike routes. Destinations are 
    more likely to be closer to each other compared to rural areas.

#### Note: You can filter the data based on marital Status, Region, and Education.
